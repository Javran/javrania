# Myself

My name is Javran (Fang) Cheng,
first year Ph.D student in University of Maryland.
I received my Bachelor degree from Northeastern University, China in 2013.

I'm still looking for a research area that I have most interest in,
but hopefully it would be some area about programming languages.

In my spare time, I
read technical books and play with exercises in it;
have fun configuring GNU/linux;
write toy scripts to make me more lazy.

Hope you enjoy yourself and find something interesting here.
