Though I have had several blogs previously, there are outdated because of my laziness (sorry about that). 
And so I decide to create this blog thanks to github and 
[Jekyll-Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/).


Actually reasons are unnecessary for my intention of creating this blog but leaving others unreclaimed, 
if any, just dumping stuffs that come into my mind and a desire of using English purely(for I\'m not a native speaker of English).

Let it be another beginning of my voyage of maintaining blogs. And I hope this time I\'m capable of keeping it up-to-date.
