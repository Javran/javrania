Since I\'ll be busy for the next few weeks, I can only devote few
of my brain power to easy programming tasks in my spare time.
Therefore, these days I\'ve started working on [exercism](http://exercism.io/).

It\'s a free website and only requires you having a github account.
They offer simple programming problems with test suites.
You can solve the problem and submit your source code to the website
so that other users would look at your code and have comments on it.

The main target is to improve the readability of your code through
comments from others and iterative refinements from yourself.

In a word, it\'s an excellent website to learn things.

My account is [here](http://exercism.io/Javran), feel free to give me comments.

See you there.
